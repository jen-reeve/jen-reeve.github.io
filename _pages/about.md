Land Acknowledgement
-----
I currently live on the lands of the Waikato iwi, and am happy to work on land returned to the Waikato iwi.
I was raised on the stolen lands of the Duwamish, Stillaguamish, Tulalip, Samish, S'Klallam, and Coast Salish peoples.
My post-secondary education took place across the stolen lands of the Lənape Haki-nk (Lenni-Lenape), Lekwungen/Songhees, Te’mexw Treaty Association, Á,LEṈENEȻ ȽTE (W̱SÁNEĆ), Coast Salish, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Ute peoples.
If you would like to learn more about the peoples displaced by colonization, I have found [Native Land](https://native-land.ca/) to be a useful resource (it provided much of the above information).

About my research
-----
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Te Whare Wananga o Waikato in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology lab.
My laboratory research is focused on the biochemistry and evolution of DNA ligases in marine picocyanobacteria, and involves molecular cloning as well as physiological assays.
In addition, I am conducting research on the controls on temperature optima from enzyme to ecosystem scales, primarily using modeling and data reanalysis methods.

My PhD research focused on our understanding of the evolution of cyanobacteria.
I specifically investigated how cyanobacteria respond to changes in salinity across physiological, evolutionary, and macroevolutionary timescales.
While this work is primarily evolutionary biology/microbiology in practice, it was intentionally framed from an Earth history perspective.

My past research has run the gamut, largely focused on interactions between microbes and the Earth system. This has included organic geochemistry, stable isotope probing, molecular cloning, dissolved gas measurements, and geochemical modeling.

About me
-----
I grew up in the Pacific Northwest (just outside of Seattle).
My interest in the outdoors, nature, and the ocean pop up in my research (pretty much all environmental).
I live with my husband and two dogs, and fill my free time with dog walks, video games, TV, knitting, and procrastinating chores.

I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, which means that I've had it all my life, but wasn't aware why some things seemed to be so much harder for me than for those around me.
In addition to ADHD, I've struggled with depression for most of my life.
I'm a firm believer in taking our mental health as seriously as our physical health.


For more info about the creation/design of this website

From the template description: "This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io)."

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
