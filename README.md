This repository was forked from [academicpages/academicapages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) on 02 April 2021. It is used to generate my [professional website](https://jen-reeve.github.io).

I recommend using [academicpages/academicapages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) if you would like to use this website as a template, but I will try to record any interesting/useful differences.
