This research applies experimental evolution as a tool to investigate evolution to environmental changes.
Most experimental evolution has been applied to understanding the genetic mechanisms of evolution.
This project moves beyond investigations into genetic mechanisms of evolution, and instead uses the well-established ability of bacteria to evolve rapidly to changing conditions as a window into bacterial evolution in deep time.

I currently have a serial transfer experiment running evaluating how cyanobacteria evolve under different salinity conditions.

I have not yet published this work, but will update this page when I do.
Once published, I will also link the GitHub repository with all my data and analysis scripts.
Until that time, if you have any questions about this project, or are interested in this dataset, please email me (jennifer.reeve@colorado.edu).

This project is a portion of my PhD research in the Geomicrobial Physiology and Evolution Lab in the [Department of Geological Sciences](https://www.colorado.edu/geologicalsciences/) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu).
