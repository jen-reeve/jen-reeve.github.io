I have not yet published this work, but will update this page when I do.
Once published, I will also link the GitHub repository with all my data and analysis scripts.
Until that time, if you have any questions about this project, or are interested in this dataset, please email me (jennifer.reeve@colorado.edu).

This project is a portion of my PhD research in the Geomicrobial Physiology and Evolution Lab in the [Department of Geological Sciences](https://www.colorado.edu/geologicalsciences/) at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu).
Data for this project comes both from lab experiments conducted during my PhD, and data mined from the literature.
