Members of the high light adapted *Prochlorococcus* ecotype lack functional NAD-dependent DNA ligases, which are believed to be the essential DNA ligase for all other bacteria.
However, members of the low light adapted *Prochlorococcus* and marine *Synechococcus* clades have either only an NAD-dependent DNA ligase, or an NAD-dependent ligase and additional ATP-dependent DNA ligases.
I am investigating the evolutionary history of these DNA ligases within the marine *Prochlorococcus* and *Synechococcus* clades as well as working on biochemical characterizations of the differences between these ligases.

This research is part of my work as a postdoctoral fellow at Te Whare Wananga o Waikato (The University of Waikato).
