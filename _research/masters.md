The primary project that I worked on during my Masters was published in [2019](https://jen-reeve.github.io/publication/2019-reeve). 
Two additional sub-projects were never published. 

The first wasn't published because we were never able to make any sense of the results (measurements which should have been anti-correlated were correlated). 
The analyses conducted in our attempts to understand the data are described in the appendix to my [thesis](https://jen-reeve.github.io/publication/2016-reeve).

The second sub-project consisted of various analyses evaluating the consistency of dissolved gas measurements made across labs and years.
These analyses were shared within the lab groups whose data were compared.

On the whole, the research I conducted during my Masters consisted of lab work, field work, and computational modeling.
During my tenure at UVic, the [lab](https://web.uvic.ca/~rhamme/research.html) had multiple Arctic and high-latitude projects going on.
As a result, our fieldwork was largely condensed to the summer months (Northern Hemisphere).
Outside of my time on the [2015 JOIS research cruise](https://www2.whoi.edu/site/beaufortgyre/expeditions/2015-expedition/), my time was primarily spent assisting with lab dissolved gas measurements, and analyzing data.
My computational work was largely limited to Matlab as Professor Roberta Hamme had already developed considerable [analytical infrastructure for dissolved gas measurements](https://web.uvic.ca/~rhamme/download.html).
