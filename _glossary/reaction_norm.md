A reaction norm is a curve showing the influence of an environmental parameter (x axis) on the fitness or growth rate of an organism (y axis).
In my work this is typically the change in growth rate over a range of salinities.
For more information on the use of reaction norms and my research using them please see my research pages on [cyanobacterial salinity reaction norms](https://jen-reeve.github.io/research/cyano-sal-rxn-norms/) and [experimental evolution of salinity tolerance in cyanobacteria](https://jen-reeve.github.io/research/cyano-exp-evo/).
