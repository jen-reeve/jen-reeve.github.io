This is the thesis that I submitted for my Masters degree from the [School of Earth and Ocean Sciences](https://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca).
The research was conducted in the [UVic Gas Tracers Lab](https://web.uvic.ca/~rhamme/research.html) under the supervision of [Professor Roberta Hamme](https://web.uvic.ca/~rhamme/index.html).
In addition to the materials which were later [published](/publications/2019-reeve), my thesis includes an appendix of analyses conducted on data from the [GEOTRACES ArcticNet 1502 cruise](https://www.bodc.ac.uk/geotraces/cruises/section_maps/arctic_ocean/#N02) for which we failed to ever understand the dynamics at play.
