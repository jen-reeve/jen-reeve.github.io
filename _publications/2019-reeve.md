This paper is based on the work conducted for my Masters degree in the [UVic Gas Tracers Lab](https://web.uvic.ca/~rhamme/index.html) in the [School of Earth and Ocean Sciences](https://www.uvic.ca/science/seos/) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) in Victoria, British Columbia.
Samples were collected as part of the [2015 Joint Ocean Ice Study](https://www2.whoi.edu/site/beaufortgyre/expeditions/2015-expedition/) and analyzed in the [UVic Gas Tracers Lab](https://web.uvic.ca/~rhamme/index.html).

Feel free to email me for a copy of this paper.
