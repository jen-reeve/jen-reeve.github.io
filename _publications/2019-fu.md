This paper is based on work I conducted as a research technician in the [Lidstrom Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/lidstrom-lab/) in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.cheme.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/). Using stable isotope probing and molecular cloning work we probed the core methylotrophic metabolism of *Methylomicrobium buryatense* 5GB1 to observe how the metabolism changes under methanol versus methane consumption.
