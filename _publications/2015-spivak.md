This paper is based off the work I conducted as a [Summer Student Fellow](https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/educate/undergraduate-programs/summer-student-fellowship/) at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](https://www.whoi.edu). We used stable isotope labeled carbon dioxide to trace the movement of carbon being fixed via photosynthesis in *Spartina alterniflora*, a salt marsh grass, into the soil microbial community. We analyzed the incorporation of the labeled carbon into membrane lipids at various depths in the soil at several time points across a 24 hour period.
