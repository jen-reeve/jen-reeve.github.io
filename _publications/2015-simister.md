This paper is based on the work conducted as a part of my undergraduate thesis as well as other members of the White Lab at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/). The fungi investigated were isolated from oil-soaked sand patties collected from Gulf of Mexico beaches by the White Lab in the years following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
